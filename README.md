# Test_Classifiers
An exploration of various text classification models

test_classifier1.py performs a sentiment analysis of user reviews from IMDB, Amazon, and Yelp, which are pre-processed in the Sentiment Labeled Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. A baseline Logistic Regression model is created and compared in technique and performance with a Deep Learning model, using the Pandas Python library and the Keras API. Code is taken from the Keras tutorial found here: https://realpython.com/python-keras-text-classification/#conclusion
